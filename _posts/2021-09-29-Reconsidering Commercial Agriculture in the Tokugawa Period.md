<p>
From the very start of their rule, the samurai lords of Tokugawa Japan fought bitterly against the commercialization of agriculture. Over the course of the 17th century, the shogunate issued multiple laws limiting the production of tobacco, oilseed, and cotton. They wanted to keep farmers focused on making rice above all else. After all, rice was the staple grain, essential to life, and, perhaps more importantly, the basis for the entire tax system. For samurai, no rice meant no food and no money. In the second half of the 17th century, however, the expansion of the commercial economy broke down this restrictive regime, marking the first triumph of a vibrant peasant-driven market economy over the conservative seigneurial economic system focused on the flow of tax rice and specie between the metropoles of Osaka and Edo. Or so the story goes.

In Honj&#333; Masanori's <a href="http://www.osaka-up.or.jp/books/ISBN978-4-87259-412-6.html">2012 book</a> he challenges nearly every aspect of this narrative. He shows persuasively that the shogunate had in fact fully incorporated commercial agricultural products into the tax system from the early 1600s. They even encouraged cotton production - perhaps the most important of all commercial crops in early modern Japan - by taxing it at a lower rate than rice. Moreover, the famous bans on oilseed, cotton, and tobacco from the middle of the century, he argues, were not permanent measures but rather temporary expedients in the face of a major famine in the 1640s. Tobacco, the most regulated crop in the 17th century, was banned not to force farmers to focus on rice. Rather, early bans were motivated by the widespread moral panic surrounding the new drug in Japan's rapidly growing cities. Townspeople with bad smoking habits often caused costly and life-threatening fires. This ban was gradually phased out of existence by the second half of the 17th century. No consistent policy forbidding the planting and sale of commercial crops ever existed.

<p>In Japanese high school history textbooks, however, the 17th century ordinances are presented as a general ban on the free planting of crops other than grains, called the *denbata katte-zukuri no kinrei*. But the key words "free planting" (*katte-zukuri*), Honj&#333; demonstrates, occur exactly 0 times in all of the extant shogunal decrees on the topic. The ban is a historiographical artifact, a myth that coalesced into orthodoxy during the Meiji period.

 Outside the obligation to pay tax rice - an obligation, as Honj&#333; illustrates in his <a href = "http://www.osaka-up.or.jp/books/ISBN978-4-87259-006-7.html">first book</a>, that never stopped Tokugawa farmers from devoting all or nearly all of their land to commercial crops - subjects of the shogun were free to plant what they liked, when they liked, and the shogunate was more than happy to meet them where they were - including all kinds of commercial agriculture within the very rice-based system of taxation so often seen as restricting the samurai authorities' capacity to extract revenues from the expanding economy. In other words, the expansion of commercial agriculture did not challenge the fiscal foundations of Tokugawa authority. Nor did the late 17th century necessarily mark a key turning point in the relationship between state and commerce. In this way, Honj&#333; challenges us to reconsider the very nature of Tokugawa attitudes towards commerce and the role of the state in Japan's preindustrial economic growth.
